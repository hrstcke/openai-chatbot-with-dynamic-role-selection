# openai-chatbot-with-dynamic-role-selection
This project is a web-based ChatBot application built using Flask and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo. The application allows users to select their role dynamically and engage in conversations with the ChatBot. The role selection feature ensures that the ChatBot tailors its responses based on the user's chosen role.
